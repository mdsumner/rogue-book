# Prerequisites

See here for how this book was made: http://rstudio.github.io/bookdown/

For now, you have to install the development versions of **bookdown**, **rmarkdown**, and **knitr**:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(
  c("bookdown", "knitr"),
  repos = c("http://yihui.name/xran", "http://cran.rstudio.com")
)
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter.
